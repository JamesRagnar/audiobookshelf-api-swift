# Compatibility

`AudiobookshelfAPI` tracks a tested compatibility range for `audiobookshelf` server versions.

## Supported Range

- Supported server range: `>= 2.26.0` and `<= 2.35.x`
- Exception: `GetSearchProviders` requires server `>= 2.31.0`
- Legacy `/api/authorize` support is not part of the current package surface

## Runtime Evaluation

Use `ServerCompatibility` with the server version returned by `CheckServerStatus`.

```swift
import AudiobookshelfAPI

switch ServerCompatibility.evaluate(serverVersion: status.serverVersion) {
case .supported:
    break
case .belowMinimum:
    // Require a newer server
case .aboveTestedRange:
    // Newer server; allow with caution if your product chooses to
case .unknownVersionFormat:
    // Could not parse version string
}
```

## Result Semantics

- `.supported`: the server is within the package's tested range
- `.belowMinimum`: the server is older than the minimum supported version
- `.aboveTestedRange`: the server is newer than the package's tested range
- `.unknownVersionFormat`: the server version string could not be parsed

## Recommended Product Behavior

- Block integration on `.belowMinimum`
- Warn or soft-gate on `.aboveTestedRange` if your app supports cautious forward use
- Treat `.unknownVersionFormat` as an operational compatibility warning

## Why This Exists

The `audiobookshelf` server evolves over time, including response-shape and access-control changes. Explicit compatibility handling lets apps make deliberate runtime decisions instead of assuming every server is identical.
